The employment sector is continuously evolving, with job seekers and employers facing numerous challenges. 
Job seekers often struggle to find suitable job opportunities that match their skills and preferences, while employers find it difficult to attract qualified candidates for their job postings. 
With the advent of advanced data analytics and machine learning, there is an opportunity to enhance the job matching process, 
making it more efficient and effective for both parties.

## Introduction
In today's competitive job market, the ability to efficiently match job seekers with relevant job opportunities is crucial. 
Leveraging data from job postings and job seeker profiles, machine learning models can significantly improve the job search experience and the quality of job applications received by employers.
This proposal outlines a plan to develop two machine learning models: 
one for optimizing job recommendations for job seekers and another for predicting the likelihood of job postings receiving a high or low number of applications.


## Business Understanding
For job seekers, finding the right job that matches their skills, preferences, and career aspirations is a challenging task. 
Similarly, employers face difficulties in creating job postings that attract the right candidates.
By addressing these challenges through advanced machine learning models, we can create a more efficient job market, benefiting both job seekers and employers.

## Problem Statement
Despite the vast amount of job postings available online, job seekers often find it challenging to identify the most relevant opportunities.
Conversely, employers struggle to understand what factors contribute to the attractiveness of their job postings, leading to a mismatch between job offers and applications. This proposal aims to solve these issues by:
1.	Providing personalized job recommendations to job seekers to match them with the most suitable job postings.
2.	Developing a machine learning model that predicts whether a job posting will receive a high or low number of applications, helping employers improve their job postings.

## Objectives
1.***Optimize Job Recommendations***: Provide personalized job recommendations to job seekers to match them with the most suitable job postings.

2.***Predict Candidate Interest***: Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a job posting will receive a high or low number of applications, enabling companies to understand which factors attract candidates the most and improve their job postings.


## Target Audience
***Job Seekers***: Individuals seeking suitable job opportunities and career growth.

***Employers***: Companies looking to recruit qualified candidates for job openings.

***Recruitment Agencies***: Agencies that assist job seekers and employers in the recruitment process.



## SUCCESS METRICS
1.Application Rate: Measure the percentage of job postings that receive applications. An increase in this rate indicates that job postings are more appealing to job seekers.

2.Qualified Application Rate: Track the percentage of applications that meet the job requirements. A higher rate signifies that job postings are attracting more suitable candidates.

3.Time to Fill: Measure the average time taken to fill a job position from the posting date to the hiring date. A reduction in this time suggests improved efficiency in attracting and hiring candidates.

4.Click-Through Rate (CTR): Monitor the percentage of job seekers who click on job postings. An increase in CTR indicates that job postings are effectively capturing job seekers' interest.

5.Candidate Engagement: Track metrics such as the number of views, shares, and saves for job postings. Higher engagement levels reflect increased interest in the job postings.
